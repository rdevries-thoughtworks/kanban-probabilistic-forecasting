# Kanban Probabilistic Forecasting

To get an idea of the notebook:

    $ ./do init  # installs dependencies
    $ ./do make  # generates the notebook and HTML
    $ ./do view  # opens the HTML in a browser

To apply this to your own data, update `data.csv`. To customize the notebook, open the (generated) `how-many-and-when.ipynb` or change `how-many-and-when.py.md`.

Artifacts are also deployed to <https://rdevries-thoughtworks.github.io/how-many-and-when.html> and <https://rdevries-thoughtworks.github.io/how-many-and-when.ipynb>.
